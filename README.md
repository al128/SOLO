	What is SOLO?
	-------------
	SOLO is a jquery and Canvas utility drop-in file, designed to speed up html5 web development and simple canvas
	application production. It is still very much in production.

	What next?
	----------
	I'm going to continue padding out SOLO with useful snippets of code, fixing bugs, and getting it all nicely
	commented, structured, minified, and documented. SOLO.JS kindof is (and will eventually be) a really handy tool to include
	in any simple canvas application. But if you are looking for a specialised game tool, or a beginner's bootstrap,
	there are better tools out there.
