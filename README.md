	What is SOLO?
	-------------
	SOLO is a jquery and Canvas utility drop-in file, designed to speed up web development and simple canvas
	application production. It contains functions for general javascript, html5 and most importantly canvas.
	It includes a good range of commonly used .js libraries plucked from around the web making it a great 
	starting point for competent JS developers.
		
	What next?
	----------
	I'm going to continue padding out SOLO with useful snippets of code, and try to get it all nicely
	commented, structured, minified, and documented. SOLO.JS should be a really handy tool to include
	in any project. But if you are looking for a specialised game tool, or a beginner's bootstrap, 
	there are better tools out there.
	
	As I start to learn Unity3D, I am hoping I can provide similar helper files in the future with
	Cavity. I am also working with a colleague on a great LESS bootstrap, cutLess.
