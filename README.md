	What is SOLO?
	-------------
	SOLO is a jquery and Canvas utility drop-in file, designed to speed up web development and simple canvas
	application production. It contains functions for general javascript, html5 and most importantly canvas.
	It includes a good range of commonly used .js libraries plucked from around the web making it a great 
	starting point for competent JS developers.
	
	What was SOLO?
	--------------
	Originally SOLO was intended to be a full JS-Canvas game engine. However, there are already a number
	of these which do a great job, and as is often the way life sometimes gets really busy and we have to
	shrink down and make sacrifices. That being said, SOLO has never been better.
	
	What next?
	----------
	I'm going to continue padding out SOLO with useful snippets of code, and try to get it all nicely
	commented and structured, and minified, and documented. SOLO.JS should be a really handy tool to include
	in any project. But if you are looking for an all in one game service, there are better tools out there.
	
	As I cast my eye towards Unity3D (like a great deal of the indie world) I hope to continue providing
	useful functionality with cutLESS, CookieShack, and Cavity.
