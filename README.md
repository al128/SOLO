	What is SOLO?
	-------------
	SOLO is a jquery extension, container helper functions for general javascript,
	html5 and most importantly canvas. It contains all sorts of useful functionality
	plucked from around the web, making it a great starting point for competent JS
	developers.
	
	What was SOLO?
	--------------
	Originally SOLO was intended to be a full JS-Canvas game engine. However, there are already a number
	of these which do a great job, and as is often the way life	sometimes gets really busy and we have to
	shrink down and make sacrifices. That being said, SOLO has never been better.
	
	What next?
	----------
	I'm going to continue padding out SOLO with useful snippets of code, and try to get it all nicely
	commented and structured, and minified, and documented. SOLO.JS should be a really handy tool to include
	in any project. But if you are looking for an all in one game service, there are better tools out there.
	
	As I cast my eye towards Unity3D (like a great deal of the indie world) I hope to continue providing
	useful functionality with cutLESS, CookieShack, and Cavity.
