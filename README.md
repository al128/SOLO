	What is SOLO?
	-------------
	SOLO is a jquery and Canvas utility drop-in file, designed to speed up html5 web development and simple canvas
	application production. It changes fairly often but it's starting to settle down.

	What next?
	----------
	I'm going to continue padding out SOLO with useful snippets of code and fixing the remaining bugs. One day it will
  be documented. SOLO.JS is a handy tool to include	in any simple canvas application.
